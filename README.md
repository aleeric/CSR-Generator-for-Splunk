# CSR Generator for Splunk

![](appserver/static/images/banner.png)

## Overview

**CSR Generator** is a Splunk app that allows users to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and a private key directly from a simple dashboard UI inside Splunk. 

The app leverages the OpenSSL binary bundled with Splunk (`splunk cmd openssl`) and is fully compatible with **Windows and Linux environments**.

## Syntax

```spl
| gencsr common_name=<string> country=<string> state=<string> locality=<string> organization=<string> organizationalunit=<string> password=<string> subjectaltname=<string>
```

---

## Example

```spl

```

## Features

- Generates CSRs using OpenSSL standards.
- Full cross-platform support (Windows and Linux).
- Customizable fields: Common Name (CN), Country (C), State (ST), Locality (L), Organization (O), Organizational Unit (OU), and SubjectAltName (SAN).
- Secure in-memory handling of key and CSR (temp files are securely deleted).
- Outputs CSR and private key directly to the Splunk UI for easy copy/paste.
- User-friendly dashboard UI with real-time validation and dynamic SAN input.
- Integrated with Splunk SPL as a custom `GeneratingCommand`.

## New in Version 0.1.0

- UI rebuilt using modular SimpleXML layout with custom JS/CSS separation and explicit grid logic.
- Decoupled rendering logic from command execution to improve maintainability and cross-browser behavior.
- Replaced STDIN key handling with file-based input to ensure openssl works reliably on both Windows and Linux.
- Output normalization: removed injected OpenSSL stderr content and ensured raw PEM output for both CSR and private key.
- Refactored dashboard styling using scoped selectors and isolation-friendly CSS to avoid conflict with Splunk base styles.
- Optimized DOM structure for better performance and rendering inside Splunkâ€™s Web Framework under constrained environments.
